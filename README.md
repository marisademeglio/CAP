## Adding content

_TODO: add github workflow instructions._

Add markdown content to any of these folders:

- `blog/posts`
- `resources`
- `certification`

## Building the latest

Build with `$npm run build`

Commit your build. Github pages will pick up what's in the `docs` folder.

_TODO: Use continuous integration instead to automate builds._
