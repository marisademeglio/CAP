# Welcome!

This is the home of Accessible Canadian Publishing on the web! Born out of the Annual Accessible Publishing Summit hosted by NNELS, this website will provide resources across the accessible publishing landscape to assist in every step of the supply chain whether you are creating accessible products or looking for them.

## Our First Steps

- Gather resources from accessibility professionals across the country and the world to create a single location that the entire Canadian publishing community can go to when they have accessibility questions
- Collect stories from people impacted by accessibility work in order to personalize accessibility and make its impact more familiar to a broad audience
- Help develop employment databases and job boards focusing on jobs related to accessibility and encouraging companies in Canada to hire people with disabilities
- Support the development of accessibility certification and host documentation relating to certification processes
- Clarify federal and provincial government legislation and processes
- Facilitate better search and discoverability of accessible content
