# About

The idea to build this site came out of the Accessible Publishing Summit in Toronto, 2019. It aims to build bridges between the many and varied accessibility resources out in the world, and those who want to use them in the context of publishing in Canada.

This online repository will bring together the templates, documentation, guides, examples, and more that already exist in the accessible publishing world and that are being built now by the Accessible Publishing Summit contributors and other active members of the accessibility community.

We welcome additional resources, suggestions for new content, and volunteers to continue the work. Please reach out using the contact us link.
